# HoldemHandComparer
This python file outlines 2 classes.
The first of which is a Card Class where each Card object is represented by a suit and a rank.
The other is a 7cardHand class where each 7cardHand object is represented by a sorted array of 7 cards (by rank) and a rank denoting 
the top 5 card hand strength of each card. 
After initializing a 7cardHand, run the ranks() function to apply the appropriate rank to the card. 
You can compare two 7cardHands with the compare function.
